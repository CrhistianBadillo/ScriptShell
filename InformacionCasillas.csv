Desk expediting: refers to the controlling of the milestones and progress of the supplier by contacting him either per email or per phone.
On-site expediting: as opposed to the desk expediting, the on-site expediting implicates that the expeditor will go on the field to meet the supplier and control himself the progress of the good’s manufacturing.
